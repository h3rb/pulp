PULP

                        Persistent Universe Logic Platform
                                      a.k.a
                        Programmable Universal Literature Platform

What is PULP?
-------------

Pulp stands for several different things.  Both Pulp and PULP are the same thing,
and what Pulp is is online gaming software for hosting mixed-mode graphical and
textual games that provide universe descriptions, real-time interactivity and
gameplay.  Related to technology of "MU" (Multi-user gaming servers like MUD,
MUCK, MOO, MUSH, LP, DUM, SMAUG, UO, EQEmu, etc.)

Pulp can be used as a modifiable string store with an attached logic system,
for the purposes of driving a rmeote graphical client, or it can be used as
a multi-player text adventure game.

Pulp takes advantage of genericized concepts like "player", "group",
"actor", "prop", "scene" to describe a world which can be faceted and
as detailed as the scripts allow for it to be.  Since Pulp's purpose is to
both provide logic, output formatting, storage of data and a simple and
effective interpreted language, it can be modified to suit the needs of
a few focused purposes.

any applicable fees as long as the amount collected annually is less than
$2000 USD.

Pulp ASCII Wordmarks and Media Standards
----------------------------------------

When discussing or documenting PULP, we request you use one of the ASCII
logo depictions found in the accompanying file 'logos.txt', or one of the
images found in /doc/logos/

If you are planning to run a gaming server, you'll have to use these
depictions and/or logos in the game itself, and on the website and other
materials associated with your game.  We want to give you a wide array
of choices so you can seamlessly integrated our logo with your trade
dress.

You are permitted to include bitmap image snapshops of the ascii renderings,
the ASCII renderings themselves, or the logo files, unmodified, with your
website, game etc.
