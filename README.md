What is PULP?
-------------

Pulp stands for several different things.  Both Pulp and PULP are the same thing,
and what Pulp is is onling gaming software for hosting mixed-mode graphical and
textual games that provide universe descriptions, real-time interactivity and
gameplay.  Related to technology of "MU" (Multi-user gaming servers like MUD,
MUCK, MOO, MUSH, LP, DUM, SMAUG, UO, EQEmu, etc.)

Pulp can be used as a modifiable string store with an attached logic system,
for the purposes of driving a rmeote graphical client, or it can be used as
a multi-player text adventure game.

Pulp takes advantage of genericized concepts like "player", "group",
"actor", "prop", "scene" to describe a world which can be facted and
as detailed as the scripts allow for it to be.  Since Pulp's purpose is to
both provide logic, output formatting, storage of data and a simple and
effective interpreted language, it can be modified to suit the needs of
a few focused purposes.
